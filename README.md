This is a project based on hardware implementation of 8-bit-computer. We have taken the inspiration from ben eater's project and made few modifications.
It really gave an insight on how to implement a large scale model such as computer on bread-board level.
There are few code files necessary for the working of eprom,segment display in arduino langauge
